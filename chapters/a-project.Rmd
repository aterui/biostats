# Appendix: Project Management

## R Project

For the entirety of this book, I will utilize the 'R Project' as the fundamental unit of workspace, where all relevant materials such as R scripts (`.R`) and data files are gathered together. There are multiple ways to organize your project, but my preferred approach is to create a single 'R Project' for a collection of scripts and data that will contribute to a single publication (see example [here](https://github.com/aterui/public-proj_stream-diversity)). To set up an 'R Project,' you will need to have both *RStudio* and the base *R* software installed. Although *R* can be used as a standalone software, I highly recommend using it in conjunction with *RStudio* due to the latter's many features that facilitate data analysis. You can download *R* and *RStudio* from the following websites:

-   [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (you can select any CRAN mirror for downloading)
-   RStudio

Once you launch *RStudio*, you will be greeted by the interface shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ui). The interface consists of three primary panels upon first opening it: the `Console`, `Environment`, and `Files`. The `Console` is where you write your code and execute calculations, data manipulation, and analysis. The `Environment` panel lists the objects you have saved, and the `Files` panel displays any files in a designated location on your computer.

```{r ui, fig.cap = "RStudio interface."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("image/r_image01.png"))
```

After pasting the script into the console, you should see the variable `x` appear in the environment panel.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

x <- c(1, 2)
```

`x` is an **object** where information is stored. In this case, we have stored a sequence of `1` and `2` in the object `x`. Once you have stored information in `x`, you can access it by simply typing `x`.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
x
```

Great! You can indeed work on your data in this manner, but it is important to note that **it is generally considered a poor practice**. As you progress through your project, you will generate a significant amount of materials, such as writing over 2000 lines of code for a single project. Therefore, it becomes crucial to implement effective code management strategies. How do you currently manage your code?

### Script Editor

It is highly recommended to manage your scripts in the `Editor` instead. The `Editor` is where you draft and fine-tune your code before executing it in the `Console`. To create space for the `Editor`, press `Ctrl + Shift + N`. A new panel will appear in the top left corner. Let's type the following script in the `Editor`. Please note that the key combination `Ctrl + Shift + N` assumes a Windows or Linux operating system. If you're using a Mac, you can use `Command + Shift + N` instead.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
y <- c(3, 4)
```

Then, hit `Ctr + S` to save the `Editor` file. *RStudio* will prompt you to enter the file name of the `Editor`[^a-project-1].

[^a-project-1]: In *R*, an editor file has an extension of `.R`.

### File Name

It is also crucial to establish consistent naming **rules** for your files. As your project progresses, the number of files within each sub-directory may increase significantly. Without clear and consistent naming rules for your files, navigating through the project can become challenging, not only for yourself but also for others involved. To alleviate this issue, consider implementing the following recommendations for file naming:

-   **NO SPACE.** Use underscore.
    -   Do: `script_week1.R`
    -   Don't: `script week1.R`
-   **NO UPPERCASE.** Use lowercase for file names.
    -   Do: `script_week1.R`
    -   Don't: `Script_week1.R`
-   **BE CONSISTENT.** Apply consistent naming rules within a project.
    -   Do: R scripts for figures always start with a common prefix, e.g., `figure_XXX.R` `figure_YYY.R`(`XXX` and `YYY` specifies further details).
    -   Don't: R scripts for figures start with random text, e.g., `XXX_fig.R` , `Figure_Y2.R` , `plotB.R`.

### Structure Your Project

If you fail to save or haphazardly store your code files on your computer, the risk of losing essential items becomes inevitable sooner or later. To mitigate this risk, I highly recommend gathering all the relevant materials within a single `R Project`. To create a new `R Project`, follow the procedure outlined below:

a.  Go to `File > New Project` on the top menu
b.  Select `New Directory`
c.  Select `New Project`

A new window will appear, prompting you to name a directory and select a location on your computer. To choose a location for the directory, click on the 'Browse' button. When organizing your project directories on your computer, I highly recommend creating a dedicated space. For instance, on my computer, I have a folder named `/github` where I store all my `R Project` directories.

The internal structure of an `R Project` is crucial for effective navigation and ensures clarity for both yourself and others when it is published. An `R Project` typically consists of various file types, such as `.R`, `.csv`, `.rds`, `.Rmd`, and others. Without an organized arrangement of these files, there is a high probability of encountering significant coding errors. Therefore, I place great importance on maintaining a well-structured project. In Table \@ref(tab:str), I present my recommended subdirectory structure.

| Name        | Content                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md` | Markdown file explaining contents in the `R Project`. Can be derived from `README.Rmd`.                                                                                       |
| `/code`     | Sub-directory for R scripts (`.R`).                                                                                                                                           |
| `/data_raw` | Sub-directory for raw data before data manipulation (`.csv` or other formats). Files in this sub-directory MUST NOT be modified unless there are changes to raw data entries. |
| `/data_fmt` | Sub-directory for formatted data (`.csv`, `.rds`, or other formats).                                                                                                          |
| `/output`   | Sub-directory for result outputs (`.csv`, `.rds`, or other formats). This may include statistical estimates from linear regression models etc.                                |
| `/rmd`      | (Optional) Sub-directory for Rmarkdown files (`.Rmd`). Rmarkdown allows seamless integration of R scripts and text.                                                           |

## Robust coding

While it is not mandatory, I highly recommend using *RStudio* in conjunction with *Git* and *GitHub*. Coding is inherently prone to errors, and even the most skilled programmers make mistakes---without exception. However, the crucial difference between beginner and advanced programmers lies in their ability to develop robust coding practices accompanied by a self-error-detection system. *Git* plays a vital role in this process. Throughout this book, I will occasionally delve into the importance of *Git* and its usage.
