I thought this would be an easy question that someone could give me the answer right away, but actually it is a deep one. The short answer is “we need statistics because we only have partial information about what we want to know.” The long answer? See below. 2.2 Example – fish density in a lake Let say we are interested in fish density in a lake (total area \\(15 \\times 15 = 225~\\text{m}^2\\)). We try to quantify it by catching fish in a certain area (1 m2 for example). Since there should be some variation in fish density among sampled points, we decided to repeat this 10 times to take an average. Figure 2.1 shows a graphical representation of this example. Figure 2.1: Lake fish density example. Points are fish, and white boxes are sampling sites with 1 sq-m Through this sampling, we got the following dataset: df_count ## # A tibble: 10 × 2 ## plot count ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 1 ## 2 2 1 ## 3 3 1 ## 4 4 2 ## 5 5 7 ## 6 6 2 ## 7 7 5 ## 8 8 1 ## 9 9 3 ## 10 10 3 Based on this dataset, we may conclude the average fish density in this lake is 2.6. However, how confident are you on this conclusion? The lake area is \\(15 \\times 15 = 225~\\text{m}^2\\) but we sampled only \\(1~\\text{m}^2 \\times 10 = 10~\\text{m}^2\\)! Indeed, we missed a lot of fish in the lake (Figure 2.2). Figure 2.2: True fish distribution in the lake In ecological research (and almost all research field), we are rarely able to obtain the perfect dataset with no uncertainty – the data are partial information of what we want to know (true fish density in the entire lake = 2.22). This is the reason why we refer to a data point as a sample, and the average fish density in white boxes (2.6) is the estimate of the true fish density because it is the inference from the incomplete information. Since the average fish density is the estimate, it does not perfectly match the true density – how do we account for this uncertainty? 2.3 Mean &amp; Variance In the above section, I talked only about the mean (total fish counts / number of plots = mean density per plot area [m2]). Let me re-write this in a little more mathematical form – I write a single data point (fish count in a single white box) as \\(y_i\\) with \\(i\\) representing an ID of a plot (therefore, \\(y_1 = 1,~y_2 = 1,~y_3 = 1,~y_4 = 2, ...y_{10}=3\\)), and refer to the number of plots as \\(N\\). The mean fish counts \\(\\mu\\) is: \\[ \\mu = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N y_i}{N} \\] However, the data contain another important aspect of information: variability in fish counts among samples. This variability – called variance – expresses the degree of uncertainty in your data. The variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) can be calculated using the deviation of each data point \\(x_i\\) from the mean \\(\\mu\\): \\[ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \\mu)^2}{N - 1} \\] In this equation, \\((y_i - \\mu)^2\\) is the deviation from the mean, but it is squared to make the deviation positive regardless the value of \\(y_i\\). Since all the deviations are positive, the summation should represent the overall deviation from the mean. We divide it by \\(N-1\\) to express it as the “average” of deviations1. Thus, cheafly speaking, variance can be interpreted as the average squared-deviation of each data point. Let’s estimate mean and variance in R. Create tibble() containing the data presented above, and perform the following analysis. Although R has built-in functions for mean (mean()) and variance (var()), I show here how to express the equations above in R codes: # define variables y &lt;- df_count$count # fish counts n &lt;- nrow(df_count) # number of plots print(y) ## [1] 1 1 1 2 7 2 5 1 3 3 print(n) ## [1] 10 # mean mu &lt;- sum(y) / n print(mu) ## [1] 2.6 # variance sigma2 &lt;- sum((y - mu)^2) / (n - 1) print(sigma2) ## [1] 4.044444 Make sure these values are identical to what you would obtain from mean() and var() functions in R. 2.4 Probability distribution The reason for dividing by \\(N-1\\), not by \\(N\\), is a statistically deep topic; in essence, this is required to obtain an unbiased estimate of variance.↩︎ "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
