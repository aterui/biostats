# Appendix

## *Git* & *GitHub*

In this section, I will cover how to integrate *Git* and *GitHub* into *R Studio*. *R Studio* is excellent as is, but it becomes even better when combined with *Git* and *GitHub*. *Git* is a free and open source distributed version control system. ***Git*** **tracks changes in your codes codes while you work on your project so you are aware of any changes you made to your script (and other) files**. Tracking changes is extremely important to avoid unintended errors in your codes. This feature also helps avoid creating redundant files. While *Git* is a local system, it has an online counterpart called *GitHub*.

To make this system work, you'll need to go through some processes. The first step is to install *Git* onto your computer:

-   **Windows**: Install *Git* from [here](https://gitforwindows.org/). You will be asked about "Adjusting your PATH environment". Choose "*Git* from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" if it is not selected.

-   **Mac**: Follow the instruction [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html).

Then open R Studio and do `Create Project` \> `New Directory` \> `New Project`. If you see a check box `Create a git repository`, check and create a new project (Figure \@ref(fig:gitcheck)). You will see a *Git* pane on the upper right panel.

```{r gitcheck, fig.cap = "After installing Git, you should see `Create a git repository`."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("image/git_image01.png"))
```

If you can't find the above, do the following: `Tools` in the menu bar \> `Terminal` \> `New Terminal`, and type `where git` in the terminal. This will tell you where git executable is located in your computer. Then, go to `Tools` in the menu bar \> `Global Options` \> `Git/SVN`. You will see *Git executable* in the box, where you can specify the location of git executable.

Next, go to [*GitHub*](https://github.com/) and create your account (free!). But, give some thoughts on your user name. My advice is the following. First, **use lowercase only.** Second, **include your name** to make it easy to find you on *GitHub*.

*R Studio* works seamlessly with *Git* or *GitHub*, but it is helpful to use a *Git client* as it provides visual aids. There are choices for a *Git client* (see options [here](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html)) but I will use *GitHub Desktop* (available [here](https://desktop.github.com/)) for our exercise. Install GitHub Desktop onto you computer.

## Commit & Push

### Register Your Git repo

Open the `R Project` you've just created as a git repository. Let's make a sample `.R` file (`Ctr + Shift + N`) and save it (name as `sample.R`). For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

## produce 100 random numbers that follows a normal distribution
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)

## estimate mean
mean(x)

## estimate SD
sd(x)

```

Open GitHub Desktop App. You will see the following GUI (Figure \@ref(fig:gitdesktop1)):

```{r gitdesktop1, fig.cap = "GUI for GitHub Desktop"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("image/git_image02.png"))
```

Hit `current repository` (top left) and `Add` \> `Add existing repository` (Figure \@ref(fig:gitdesktop2)):

```{r gitdesktop2, fig.cap = "Add dropdown on the top left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("image/git_image03.png"))
```

### Commit

GitHub Desktop will prompt you to enter a local path to your *Git* repository. Browse and select your directory of the `R Project` - the local Git repository will show up in the list of repositories in *GitHub Desktop* (left side bar in Figure\@ref(fig:gitdesktop2))*.* Now, you are ready to **Commit** your files to *Git*! Commit is the procedure to record your file change history in *Git*. To make this happen, click your *Git* repository on GitHub Desktop, and you will see the following:

```{r gitdesktop3, fig.cap = "You will see `Create sample.R` or `summary (required)` on the bottom left"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("image/git_image04.png"))
```

At this stage, your file (`.R` or else) is saved onto your local directory, **but has not been recorded in *Git* as a change history.** To make a Commit, the first thing to do is to choose a file(s). There are checkboxes next to each of the new files. If this box is checked, you are going to commit changes to *Git*. Once you selected the files you want to make a commit, go to the bottom left of the window. There is a small box saying `summary (required)` or `Create sample.R`.This is the place where you can put any title that describes what you did in this commit, and **you cannot Commit unless you enter this information!** For example, I would write `initial commit` for this exercise - from the second commit, you should put a more informative commit message so you can track changes when needed. You can google recommendations for how to write commit titles/descriptions. Then hit `commit to master`. **Now, changes to the selected files have been recorded in *Git*!**

### Push

Remember, your changes are recorded in your local computer **but not published in your online repository!** To send local changes to the online *GitHub* repository, you will need to **Push** commits via *GitHub Desktop*. Push is the procedure to send your Commit(s) to *GitHub*. Once you do a Commit, *GitHub Desktop* will ask you whether you want to Push it to an online repository (Figure \@ref(fig:gitdesktop4)). If this is the first push, there is no corresponding repository on *GitHub* tied to your local repository, so *GitHub Desktop* will ask you if you want to publish it on *GitHub* (NOTE: although it says 'publish', your repository will remain private unless you explicitly tell *Git Desktop* to make it public). If you are comfortable with the changes you made, **Push** it!

```{r gitdesktop4, fig.cap = "To Push your code, hit the highlighted menu button"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("image/git_image05.png"))
```

### Edit

We went through how we get things uploaded onto *GitHub*, but what happens if we make changes to existing files? To see this, let's make a minor change to your R script. We have created a file `sample.R`:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

## produce 100 random numbers that follows a normal distribution
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)

## estimate mean
mean(x)

## estimate SD
sd(x)

```

Edit this as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

## produce 100 random numbers that follows a normal distribution
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)

## estimate mean
median(x)

## estimate SD
var(x)

```

After making this change, go to *GitHub Desktop* again. *GitHub Desktop* automatically detects the difference between the new and old files and shows which part of the script has been edited! This helps coding quite a bit:

```{r gitdesktop5, fig.cap = "Git detects edits to your codes"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("image/git_image06.png"))
```
