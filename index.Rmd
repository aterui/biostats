# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This textbook is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to fundamental statistical techniques and their practical applications in the context of biological data analysis. What sets this book apart is its "flipped-order" approach to teaching. Unlike traditional statistics courses that often begin with theoretical concepts, this book takes a different approach by initially presenting real-world data. By grounding the material in practical scenarios, it aims to make the learning process more accessible, particularly for those who are new to statistics.

Through the "flipped-order" introduction, readers will be able to engage with concrete examples of statistical methods in use before delving into the underlying theories and concepts that support them. This pedagogical approach aims to provide a solid foundation for readers to comprehend and apply statistical techniques effectively in the biological sciences.
