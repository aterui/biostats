# What is R and R studio?

In this book, we will use R and RStudio to organize, analyze, and visualize data.

**R** is a programming language and software environment specifically designed for statistical computing and data analysis. It is widely used by data analysts, statisticians, and researchers for tasks like:

-   Data manipulation and visualization

-   Statistical modeling

-   Programming

R is open-source, which means it's free to use and constantly improved by a large community of contributors.

**RStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It provides a user-friendly interface to write, debug, and run R code. While R itself is just a console-based language, RStudio enhances productivity with features like:

-   Script editor: Write and save R code with syntax highlighting.

-   Console: Run R commands interactively.

-   Environment pane: View variables, datasets, and objects in your workspace.

-   Plots pane: Display and export visualizations directly.

-   Package manager: Install and manage R packages effortlessly.

RStudio helps bridge the gap between R’s powerful capabilities and ease of use, making it a preferred tool for working with R.

| **Feature**   | **R**                | **RStudio**                         |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Type**      | Programming language | Development environment for R       |
| **Interface** | Console-based        | User-friendly IDE with GUI          |
| **Usage**     | Runs R commands      | Makes R coding easier and organized |

In summary, **R** is the engine for analysis, and **RStudio** is the dashboard that makes driving the engine simpler!

# R Project

Throughout this book, we will use an **R Project** as the central workspace unit. An R Project provides a unified location where all relevant materials—such as R scripts (.R files) and data sets—are organized and managed. While there are various ways to structure your projects, I recommend creating a single R Project for each collection of scripts and data that contribute to a specific publication.

## Setup R Project

To set up an R Project, open RStudio and follow the procedure outlined below:

a.  Go to `File > New Project` on the top menu
b.  Select `New Directory`
c.  Select `New Project`

A new window will appear, prompting you to name a directory and select a location on your computer. To choose a location for the directory, click on the 'Browse' button. When organizing your project directories on your computer, I highly recommend creating a dedicated space. For instance, on my computer, I have a folder named `github/` where I store all my `R Project` directories.

Now, go to the R Project folder you created, and double-click on `.Rproj` file. You will encounter the interface depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:ui). Initially, the interface comprises three primary panels: **Console**, **Environment**, and **Files**.

**Console** is where you execute calculations, data manipulation, and analysis by running codes. **Environment** panel lists the saved objects, while the **Files** panel displays files in a designated location on your computer.

```{r ui, echo=F, fig.cap = "RStudio interface."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("image/r_image01.png"))
```

Let's play a little bit in the console to see what happens. After pasting the script into the console, you will notice that the variable `x` appears in the environment panel.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

x <- 1
```

`x` is an object that stores information. In this particular case, we have stored `1` in the object `x`. Once you have stored information in `x`, you can access it by simply typing `x`.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
x
```

Excellent! Let's try the following simple exercise to get used to it:

1.  Create object `y` and store `2` in it.

2.  Create object `zero` and store `0` in it.

### Script Editor

While you can type your code directly into the console, this approach is generally considered poor practice. As your project grows, the complexity increases, often leading to the accumulation of substantial material—potentially exceeding 2,000 lines of code in a single project. Managing and revisiting code written directly in the console quickly becomes unwieldy and inefficient.

It is highly recommended to manage your scripts in the `Editor` instead. The `Editor` is where you draft and fine-tune your code before executing it in Console. To create space for the `Editor`, press `Ctrl + Shift + N`. A new panel will appear in the top left corner. Type the following script in the `Editor` (note that the key combination `Ctrl + Shift + N` assumes a Windows or Linux operating system. If you're using a Mac, you can use `Command + Shift + N` instead).

```{r, echo = TRUE}
y <- 5
```

Then, hit `Ctr + S` to save the `Editor` file. RStudio will prompt you to enter the file name of the `Editor`[^gs-01-rstudio-1] and where to save it as `.R` file.

[^gs-01-rstudio-1]: In *R*, an editor file has an extension of `.R`.

### File Name {.unnumbered}

It is also crucial to establish consistent naming **rules** for your files. As your project progresses, the number of files within each sub-directory may increase significantly. Without clear and consistent naming rules for your files, navigating through the project can become challenging, not only for yourself but also for others involved. To alleviate this issue, consider implementing the following recommendations for file naming:

-   **NO SPACE.** Use underscore.
    -   Do: `script_week1.R`
    -   Don't: `script week1.R`
-   **NO UPPERCASE.** Use lowercase for file names.
    -   Do: `script_week1.R`
    -   Don't: `Script_week1.R`
-   **BE CONSISTENT.** Apply consistent naming rules within a project.
    -   Do: R scripts for figures always start with a common prefix, e.g., `figure_XXX.R` `figure_YYY.R`(`XXX` and `YYY` specifies further details).
    -   Don't: R scripts for figures start with random text, e.g., `XXX_fig.R` , `Figure_Y2.R` , `plotB.R`.

### Structure Your Project {.unnumbered}

The internal structure of an R Project is crucial for effective navigation and ensures clarity for both yourself and others when it is published. An `R Project` typically consists of various file types, such as `.R`, `.csv`, `.rds`, `.Rmd`, and others. Without an organized arrangement of these files, there is a high probability of encountering significant coding errors. Therefore, I place great importance on maintaining a well-structured project. In Table \@ref(tab:str), I present my recommended subdirectory structure.

| Name        | Content                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md` | Markdown file explaining contents in the `R Project`. Can be derived from `README.Rmd`.                                                                                       |
| `code/`     | Sub-directory for R scripts (`.R`).                                                                                                                                           |
| `data_raw/` | Sub-directory for raw data before data manipulation (`.csv` or other formats). Files in this sub-directory MUST NOT be modified unless there are changes to raw data entries. |
| `data_fmt/` | Sub-directory for formatted data (`.csv`, `.rds`, or other formats).                                                                                                          |
| `output/`   | Sub-directory for result outputs (`.csv`, `.rds`, or other formats). This may include statistical estimates from linear regression models etc.                                |
| `rmd/`      | (Optional) Sub-directory for Rmarkdown files (`.Rmd`). Rmarkdown allows seamless integration of R scripts and text.                                                           |

## Robust coding {.unnumbered}

While it is not mandatory, I highly recommend using RStudio in conjunction with *Git* and *GitHub*. Coding is inherently prone to errors, and even the most skilled programmers make mistakes – without exception. However, the crucial difference between beginner and advanced programmers lies in their ability to develop robust coding practices accompanied by a self-error-detection system. *Git* plays a vital role in this process. Throughout this book, I will occasionally delve into the importance of *Git* and its usage.
