# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This textbook aims to introduce fundamental statistical techniques and their applications to biological data. A unique aspect of this book is the "flipped-order" introduction. Many statistics courses start with theory; yet, I found it difficult for those unfamiliar with statistics. I will start with a real example of the method, followed by the explanation for an underlying theory/concept. The author is an ecologist, so some methods in this book might not be popular in other fields.
