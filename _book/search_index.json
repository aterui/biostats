[["why-statistics.html", "Chapter 2 Why statistics? 2.1 The rationale 2.2 Example", " Chapter 2 Why statistics? 2.1 The rationale Why do I need statistics in ecology in the first place? - this is the first question I got when I stepped into the field of ecology. I thought this would be an easy question that someone could give me the answer right away, but actually it is a deep one. The short answer is “we need statistics because we only have partial information about what we want to know.” The long answer? See below. 2.2 Example Let say we are interested in fish density in a lake (total area \\(15 \\times 15 = 225~\\text{m}^2\\)). We try to quantify it by catching fish in a certain area (1 m2 for example). Since there should be some variation in fish density among sampled points, we decided to repeat this 10 times to take an average. Figure 2.1 shows a graphical representation of this example. Figure 2.1: Lake fish density example. Points are fish, and white boxes are sampling sites with 1 sq-m Through this sampling, we got the following dataset: ## # A tibble: 10 × 2 ## plot count ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 1 ## 2 2 1 ## 3 3 1 ## 4 4 2 ## 5 5 7 ## 6 6 2 ## 7 7 5 ## 8 8 1 ## 9 9 3 ## 10 10 3 Based on this dataset, we may conclude the average fish density in this lake is 2.6. However, how confident are you on this conclusion? The lake area is \\(15 \\times 15 = 225~\\text{m}^2\\) but we sampled only \\(1~\\text{m}^2 \\times 10 = 10~\\text{m}^2\\)! Indeed, we missed a lot of fish in the lake (Figure 2.2). Figure 2.2: True fish distribution in the lake In ecological research (and almost all research field), we are rarely able to obtain the perfect dataset, i.e., no uncertainty in the data.
